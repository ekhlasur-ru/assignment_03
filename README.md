# Vehicle Rental System – Database Design & SQL Queries

## Project Overview

This project shows basic database design and SQL queries using a simple Vehicle Rental System.

## What This Project Covers

- Design an ERD with proper relationships
- Understand and apply PK & FK
- Write optimized SQL queries based on real-world scenarios

## Database Tables

The project has 3 tables:

- Users
- Vehicles
- Bookings

### Relationships

- One User → many Bookings
- One Vehicle → many Bookings
- Each Booking links one User and one Vehicle

## Project Logic

- Each user has a unique email
- Each vehicle has a unique registration number
- Bookings store rental period, status and total cost
- Vehicles have availability status (available / rented / maintenance)

## SQL Queries Used

- JOIN → Get booking details with user and vehicle info
- EXISTS → Find vehicles that were never booked
- WHERE → Get available vehicles by type (eg: car)
- GROUP BY & HAVING → Find vehicles booked more than two times

## Viva Video
